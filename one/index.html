<p>Am I an angry, frustrated person?  I don't really think so, and many people who know me well often characterize me as patient, thoughtful, and slow to anger, to use vaguely Biblical wording.</p><p>

I want to write.  This piece itself constitutes the first tangible artifact of this desire which has been building in me for some time.  I've written items before, both for classes and of my own volition, but in the current course of my life I don't write much.  I don't write much English, that is.  Let me rephrase.  I do write a not insignificant amount of English.  However, on a daily basis I write, read, and think more in software code than in English, and what English I do write tends to be a translation of ideas which are native to and more fluently expressed in software.  They also tend to be rather practical and to the point, starting, ending, and suffused with the grown-up equivalent of "tl;dr": "In summary".  </p><p>

I love working with software and only want to grow better at it, but I sense my skills with manipulating, expressing, and communicating ideas in English prose have languished and atrophied from disuse since I've started writing software professionally.  I'm not claiming I was a good writer beforehand or that writing came easily to me.  In fact, my most salient memories of writing all center around my lack of ability and versatility in the domain.  Through some fluke of scheduling, I managed to squeak past the first three semesters of college without writing a serious paper, by which I mean a paper of more than two pages of a non-technical variety (lab reports, project write-ups, etc. don't count for obvious reasons).  After that, I can recall two classes which actually challenged me to formulate theses and expend energy defending them in prose.  There were some other classes which made motions and feints in this direction but were quickly shown to be vacuous.  </p><p>

Although its presence is obvious, I can't blame my particular experience solely on the decline of rigor in college courses; as a freshman I remember being surrounded by people who were stuck writing ten page papers on the standard freshmen course topics.  I managed to avoid Freshman Composition and land in a mandatory philosophy class with a motivated, young, freshly-minted professor who espoused seminar discussions in class and generally didn't hand out assignments of a regurgitative nature. </p><p>

In short, I wrote approximately six papers in college which I would accord any serious weight.  Even those I mostly remember agonizing over, drowning my frustration at a momentary failure to find the most succinct word or phrasing in a forty-minute traversal of the Internet's commitment-free entertainments.  My strategy mostly consisted of staying up late enough to shut down whatever center of my brain which emanates inhibitions until I came up with four paragraphs describing a point in sloppy phrasing and then copy-editing the next day.  I've since discovered that alcohol can have a similar effect. </p><p>

In general I'm fine with the tactic of smattering a stream of consciousness across digital paper in order to provide a fertile wellspring for more chiseled ideas, but it doesn't come naturally to me.  In the Hemingway (or was it Steinbeck?) unit in high school, we were told that he wrote in two to three word increments, always adding and never revising or removing.  This appealed to me, probably because it provided a quantitative measure of completion and an analogy to my favorite childhood pastime of Legos was not far out of reach. But combining it with my tendency towards perfectionism, some dim awareness of the breadth of the lexical universe, and the <a href='http://xkcd.com/477/'>Internet's infinitely recursive rabbit hole of distraction</a> only resulted in frequent misfires and false starts.  Also, I shouldn't need to turn off half of my brain through external stimulants in order to get anything onto paper.  That's just weak, bro.
</p><p>
My perfectionism has been with me as long as I remember, although I didn't really label it as such until much later.  Maybe it didn't actually exist in me until it was given and legitimized by that label.  I remember agonizing over the first sentence of a first grade book report on the patron saint of Irish car bombs and that tacky shade of green.  It ended up being "St. Patrick was born somewhere in Europe," which was lauded as a start but was really a transparent lift of the first sentence of the back-cover blurb: "St. Patrick was born somewhere in Britain."  At least I had geographic hierarchies down.
</p><p>
This post reminds me most of <a href='http://xkcd.com/621/'>something I don't want to be</a>.  But the whole point of this space is that I won't and am not allowed to care.  Caring has only resulted in not writing or publishing anything up until this point.
</p><p>
I don't consider myself an angry or frustrated person, but in trying to think of a name for this space, my first two candidates were "frustrated" and "screeds".  <a href='http://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_suburbia.html'>Screeds aren't fun to listen to, even if you agree with the message</a>, so I'll avoid those here.  In addition, they're rarely productive or effective, both of which are qualities worth considering in communication.
</p><p>
More to come, surely, but that's all for now.
